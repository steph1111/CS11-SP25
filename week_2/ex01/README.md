## Background information 
When you are working on a collaborative project, you will need to read code written by others and find mistakes (bugs!). GitHub makes suggesting changes or reporting problems in code easy with GitHub issues.

## Instructions
1. Open one of the `bug.cpp` files on the `CS11-SP25` repo from GitHub website (see `ex01`).
1. Find the bug. Discuss the code with people around you as needed.
1. Click on the line number the bug is on. Then click the three dots > `Reference in a new issue`.
1. You will be navigated to the issue creation page. Give the issue a title and fix what is wrong.
